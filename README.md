# Kanri

Kanri (lit. management) is a minimalist authorization framework inspired by
others such as Kan and Pundit. It aims to accomplish most basic authorization
tasks in as simple a manner as possible, without sacrificing functionality.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'kanri', git: 'https://github.com/Co-Chu/Kanri'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage

Kanri authorizes actions based on roles defined in a class. For example:

```ruby
class SomeClass
    include Kanri

    role :admin do
        detect { |user, _| user.admin? }
        can :edit, Object
    end
    role :anyone do
        can :read, Object
    end
end

some_obj = SomeClass.new
some_obj.can?(:edit, some_object, user: some_admin) # => true
```

Role names are not currently used for anything in particular other than adding a
readable tag to the permissions group.
